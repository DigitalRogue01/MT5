This project focuses on the development of an **MT5 trading system integrated with an external AI decision engine**. The core objective is to extract structured, high-quality market data directly from MetaTrader 5—including full candle OHLC values, session context (Asia/London/New York), indicator states (MACD, VWAP, ATR, ADX, etc.), and key price levels—and package that data into consistent JSON payloads. These payloads are transmitted to an AI model (local or API-based) which evaluates market conditions and returns actionable trade guidance such as bias, confidence, regime classification, and rationale. The EA is designed to act as a reliable “bridge” between MT5 and AI, ensuring deterministic data flow, logging, and traceability.

Current work has emphasized **robustness, transparency, and testability**. This includes fixing compile errors, resolving zero-trade conditions, refining indicator logic (such as MACD histogram weakening, no-trade zones, and momentum confirmation), improving CSV and log readability, and adding on-chart HUD feedback so AI decisions can be visually audited against price action. The longer-term vision is a modular, extensible AI-assisted trading framework where MT5 handles execution and market mechanics, while the AI provides adaptive analysis and decision support—allowing for rapid iteration, backtesting, and eventual live deployment with clear insight into *why* each trade was or was not taken.
